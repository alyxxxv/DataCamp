# Introduction to SQL

**Onboarding | Query Result**

Notice the query result tab in the bottom right corner of your screen. This is where the results of your SQL queries will be displayed.
Run this query in the editor and check out the resulting table in the query result tab!

``` sql
SELECT name FROM people;
```
**Beginning your SQL journey**

Now that you're familiar with the interface, let's get straight into it.
SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.
You can think of a relational database as a collection of tables. A table is just a set of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, which represents exactly one type of entity. For example, a table might represent employees in a company or purchases made, but not both.
Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a single entity. For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. Each column, or field, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees.
